# Hotel Data Scraping Project

## Overview
This project is designed to scrape hotel information from a designated website, reorganize the data into a structured table, and perform insightful analyses. The primary focus is on extracting critical findings regarding hotel pricing dynamics and the optimal timing for booking. Additionally, the project includes a predictive model that estimates hotel rankings based on webpage data.

## Features

- **Data Scraping:** Automated extraction of hotel details from web pages, including prices, locations, amenities, and reviews.
- **Data Organization:** The scraped data is structured into a clear and concise table format, making it easy to interpret and analyze.
- **Analysis of Pricing and Timing:** In-depth analysis that uncovers significant insights into how hotel prices change over time and when is the likely best time to book a hotel room.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes machine learning to predict the ordering of hotels based on factors extracted from their webpages, such as features, popularity, and customer reviews.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install necessary Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas scikit-learn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://yourrepositorylink.com/yourproject.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and install required Python packages.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command from the root of the project directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the script you use to initiate the scraping process. Customize the script according to your target website and desired data.

## Key Findings

1. **Timing for Booking:** Our analysis indicates that [describe the key timing insights, e.g., booking x days in advance is typically cheaper].
2. **Hotel Pricing Trends:** We've identified significant trends in how hotel prices change, such as [describe general trends, e.g., price increases during peak seasons or weekends].

## Predictive Model Insights

The predictive model provides an ordered list of hotels based on their likelihood to be preferred by potential customers, informed by the extracted webpage data. This feature can assist users in making informed decisions while selecting hotels.
